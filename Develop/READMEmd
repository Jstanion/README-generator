# Professional README Generator

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

I wanted to provide an easier way to create a README file without having to copy and paste from an online format. I built this application so that all future projects would have a more polished README file and follow the same structure and format for each one. Being able to use this generator will allow me to create a README file without having to find an example online and modify it's content. I learned quite a bit about node modules, specifically the inquirer package, and how it can be used to create many different prompts for more detailed questions and answers.  I also learned how to export/import functions to seperate file components and allow for smaller and cleaner code. Using multiple javascript files and linking them together allows for more seperation of concerns when working with a team on future applications and projects.

## Installation

-You will need to initialize the npm package by running npm init in the terminal. Once institialized, you can then install the package by running npm i in the terminal. Finally, you want to make sure to have the inquirer version 8.2.4 installed by running npm i inquirer@version8.2.4. After all these are installed you should be able to invoke the application by running node index.js in the terminal.

## Usage

Usage of this application is fairly straight forward. Once you initialize the program, you can navigate through each prompt by providing answers to the corresponding questions. If you are presented with a prompt asking for a section that you do not wish to add to the readme, just respond no to the prompt and it will not include a response for that section in the README file. Make sure to include correct filepaths for any URL or filepath requests, or it will return a broken image or link in the markdown text and require correction later on.
